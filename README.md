# windtunnelGIP

A home built wind tunnel for my high school thesis.

In "eindwerk finale versie.pdf" the whole project is explained and summarised.
The translation (Thesis final version Dutch to English by Google Translate.pdf) has been translated by Google Translate. This means that words, scentences, and names may be translated incorrectly. 
The Dutch version is the original one.

I do not reccomend using the manufacturing files, as a lot has been modified and changed after laser cutting.
Please use this as a reference and inspiration, not as a manual.

If more information or explenation is required, feel free to contact me!
